# Image Resizer plugin for Phonegap/Cordova 3.0+ #

This plugin resizes images natively using the phonegap / cordova architecture.

## Adding the Plugin to your project ##

The plugin conforms to the Cordova plugin specification, it can be installed
using the Cordova / Phonegap command line interface.

```
phonegap plugin add cordova-plugin-image-resizer

cordova plugin add cordova-plugin-image-resizer
```

## Using the plugin ##

The plugin creates the object `window.imageResizer`. `window.plugins.imageResizer` still works for older versions.

To use, call one of the following, available methods:

```javascript
   window.imageResizer.resizeImage(successCallBack, failCallBack, imageData, width, height, options);
   window.imageResizer.getImageSize(successCallBack, failCallBack, imageData, options);
   window.imageResizer.storeImage(successCallBack, failCallBack, imageData, options);
```

For Example:
```javascript
window.imageResizer.resizeImage(
   function(data) { 
     var image = document.getElementById('myImage');
     image.src = "data:image/jpeg;base64," + data.imageData; 
   }, function (error) {
     console.log("Error : \r\n" + error);
   }, imageDataInBase64, 0.5, 0.5, {
      resizeType: ImageResizer.RESIZE_TYPE_FACTOR,
      imageDataType: ImageResizer.IMAGE_DATA_TYPE_BASE64,
      format: ImageResizer.FORMAT_JPG
   }
);
```

### Android quirks and howto's ###

Android 2.3+ is supported

The storeImage funtion will always store the image to the device's default external storage, under the given Directory and filename. the photoAlbum property will be ignored.

### iOS quirks and howto's ###

For a full iOS integration, two extra extensions should be used:

1. Base64 Encoder/Decoder using Dave Wimer implementation (http://colloquy.info/project/browser/trunk/NSDataAdditions.h?rev=1576)
2. Image Scaling for UIImage (Using the great howto guide here : http://iphonedevelopertips.com/graphics/how-to-scale-an-image-using-an-objective-c-category.html )

The sources are added to the github.

The storeImage function in iOS saves either in the photo album, or in the application's temporary directory. 
In the first case (photo album is set to true), the filename and directory will be completly ignored. A filename will be decided by iOS itself.
In the second case, only filename will be used and directory will be ignored.
